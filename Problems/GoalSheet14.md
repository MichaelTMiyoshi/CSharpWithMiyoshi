# Goal Sheet 14

Williams Game Engine (Part 2)

If youhave not already done so, make sure to clone the [Williams Game Engine tutorial](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/WilliamsGameEngine.CSharp) and complete the tutorial up through meteor showers.  Then, continue with the rest of the tutorial.  Completing the different sections of the tutorial are the tasks for the goal sheet.

**Collisions**

Destroy meteors when the lasers collide with them.

**Animation**

Make an explosion animation when the lasers destroy the meteors.

**Sound**

Give sound to lasers and explosions.

**Score**

Make the score increase when meteors are hit.  Decrease lives when meteors get to the end of the screen.  Display both as they happen.

**Ending Screen**

Display the user's final score and give the opportunity to play again.

**Scrolling Background**

The scrolling background has no directions.  In other words, you need to apply what you have learned about sprites and movement.

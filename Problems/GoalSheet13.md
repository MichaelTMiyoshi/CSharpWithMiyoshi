# Goal Sheet 13

Williams Game Engine (Part 1)

Make sure to clone the [Williams Game Engine tutorial](https://github.com/MichaelTMiyoshi/WilliamsGameEngine.CSharp) and follow the tutorial.  Completing the different sections of the tutorial are the tasks for the goal sheet.

**Sprite**

Make the ship sprite appear on the screen.

**Movement**

Make the ship move using the arrow keys.  Note.  You may change the keys the user uses to move.

**Shooting**

Shoot lasers from the ship.  These will be used later to destroy the meteors that fly across the screen.

**Meteor**

Create the meteor class and have a single meteor fly across the screen.  You will make meteors show on the screen with the meteor shower.

**Meteor Shower**

Make more than just a single meteor fly across the screen instead of having just one.
